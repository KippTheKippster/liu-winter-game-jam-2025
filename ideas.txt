Peakmin
	Intro
	Smaller rewards that take time to get (like fishing holes)
	Heavy objects/Things that require multiple penguins
	More things that take time (bridges, walls, etc.)
	Key items to collect (things to "complete" a level)
	More dense levels (not so much empty space/less water and thinner walls)
	A good filler enemy (like bulborb)

Peak level:
	Are more penguins needed?
	More big tasks/auto tasks (such as building bridges)
	Bad:
		Bottom too empty and big
		Top too small and cluttered
		Enemies need more health
		No need to multitask
		Feels more like ticking check boxes rather than completing a task 
	Good:
		Player needs to pay attention to tree mimic
		Its fun spreading penguins across map and multitasking
		Combining enemies makes it more difficult and interesting
